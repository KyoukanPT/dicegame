<h2> Dice Game </h2>

<p>This a very simple dice game that I created in my spare time to test my HTML, CSS, Javascript and DOM skills.</p>

<strong>The rules of the game are :</strong>
<br>
- The dice with the higher number wins
- If the dice numbers are the same, it's a draw
- To play again, click on the "Play Again" button
